# Viewing Party

This is the base repo for the [Viewing Party Lite project](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/viewing_party_lite) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

### About this Project

Viewing Part Lite is an application in which users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for themselves and other users of the application.

## Learning Goals for this Project
1. Consume multiple endpoints from an external API that requires authentication 
2. Test consumption of APIs with RSpec
3. Utlize Facade/Service/Poro design 
4. Organize and refactor code to be more maintainable
5. Implement login functionality and authentication in app using session 


## Local Setup for Project

1. Fork and Clone the repo
2. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
3. Setup the database: `rails db:create`

## Project Progress
This project was originally a paired project completed over 4 days, using both Driver/Navigator and working asynchronously reviewing each other's code on GitHub before merging to main and deploying to Heroku. The `original_submission` branch hosts the code that was completed when the project was due.

After it was submitted I used it to practice refactoring and apply the features and tests that did not make it into our original submission. These additions can be found on the branch 

In the weeks after this project we learned about authentication and sessions and I implemented those new skills into this app, followed by authorization. The latest version of the complete project is found on the `main` branch.

## Deployment
Since this was a backend project the deployment might not be the most pleasing to the eye, but it is functional and I plan to practice frontend skills on this project at some point in the future.
You can find the deployed app [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/salty-oasis-88675)
