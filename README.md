# Viewing Party

This project was completed during my 13th week at Turing School of Software and Design in the Backend Software Development Program. It was assigned as a paired project to be completed in a 4 day sprint. Since the original submission I have refactored and added features as I learned new skills. It was my first time consuming an external API that required authentication, and my first time implementing the Service/Facade/Poro design. I will continue to practice new skills on this application as I learn them. More details about what I have added are listed below in **Project Progress**. Thank you for taking an interest and I look forward to any questions you may have.

This is the base repo for the [Viewing Party Lite project](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/viewing_party_lite) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

### About this Project

Viewing Part Lite is an application in which users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for themselves and other users of the application.

## Learning Goals for this Project
1. Consume multiple endpoints from an external API that requires authentication 
2. Test consumption of APIs with RSpec
3. Utlize Facade/Service/Poro design 
4. Organize and refactor code to be more maintainable
5. Implement login functionality and authentication in app using session 
6. Test API calls using webmock, VCR 


## Local Setup for Project

1. Fork and Clone the repo
2. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
3. Setup the database: `rails db:create`

## Project Progress
This project was originally a paired project completed over 4 days, using both Driver/Navigator and working asynchronously reviewing each other's code on GitHub before merging to main and deploying to Heroku. The `original_submission` branch hosts the code that was completed when the project was due.

After it was submitted I used it to practice refactoring and apply the features and tests that did not make it into our original submission. These additions can be found on the branch `post_project`.

In the weeks after this project we learned about authentication and sessions and I implemented those new skills into this app, followed by authorization. The latest version of the complete project is found on the `main` branch.

## Deployment
Since this was a backend project the deployment might not be the most pleasing to the eye, but it is functional and I plan to practice frontend skills on this project at some point in the future.
You can find the deployed app [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/salty-oasis-88675)

## Versions
